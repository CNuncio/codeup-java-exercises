// work in progress
// create a static method named blackFridaySale. This method should:
//        Take in an ArrayList of Device objects
//        The method should return an ArrayList of Device objects where each device's price is lowered with a discount based on the following rules:
//        If the device brand is Apple it gets a 5% off on the normal price.
//        If the device brand is Microsoft it gets a 7% off on the normal price;
